      "description": "Managing your money wisely is the foundation of financial freedom. Start by tracking every expense—knowing where your money goes is the first step to taking control. Next, create a budget that aligns with your goals, prioritizing saving and debt repayment. Remember, building wealth isn’t about how much you earn, but how much you keep and grow. Invest consistently, stay patient, and avoid impulsive spending. Over time, small, smart decisions compound into lasting financial security.",

      "author": "Dr Banu Mushtaq ",
      "description": "In Heart Lamp In Heart Lamp, Banu Mushtaq exquisitely captures the everyday lives of women and girls in Muslim communities in southern India. Published originally in the Kannada, these portraits of family and community tensions testify to Mushtaq’s years as a journalist and lawyer, in which she tirelessly championed women’s rights and protested all forms of caste and religious oppression. Written in a style at once witty, vivid, colloquial, moving and excoriating, it’s in her characters – the sparky children, the audacious grandmothers, the buffoonish maulvis and thug brothers, the oft-hapless husbands, and the mothers above all, surviving their feelings at great cost – that Mushtaq emerges as an astonishing writer and observer of human nature, building disconcerting emotional heights out of a rich spoken style. Her opus has garnered both censure from conservative quarters as well India’s most prestigious literary awards; this is a collection sure to be read for years to come.",
